# TODO

- [ ] Documentation at texbld.github.io

## Possible new Features

- [ ] Alias system in `~/.config/texbld/aliases.toml`
- [ ] Testing that an image builds properly without creating a project.
- [ ] Automatic package manager deduction in a v2 sourceimage parser
- Creating a custom registry? (Not likely due to stability issues)
